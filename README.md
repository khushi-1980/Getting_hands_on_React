# ⚛️ Getting Hands-On with React  

Welcome! 👋  
This repository is my personal *React Lab, where I experiment, practice, and build **mini projects* as I learn React step by step.  

Instead of just reading tutorials, I’m getting hands-on and creating something new every day based on the concept I learned.
